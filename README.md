## STANDALONE DEMO
✅ Zero Impact on PhoenixFlix Performance
1. Separate Asset Loading
PhoenixFlix users: Only load PhoenixFlix assets (app.js, styles.css)
AccFirmDemo users: Only load accounting demo assets (/AccFirmDemo/css/*, /AccFirmDemo/js/*)
No cross-contamination: Browsers only request files for the current page

2. Build Process Unchanged
Your FULL_build-optimized-clean.ps1 script:
Only minifies specific PhoenixFlix files
Ignores the AccountingFirmDemo/ folder completely
Build time remains exactly the same

3. Route-Based Separation
phoenixflix.vercel.app/          → PhoenixFlix app
phoenixflix.vercel.app/AccFirmDemo → Accounting demo

Copy
Different routes = different assets loaded
Zero overlap in resource loading

4. File Size Impact
Accounting demo adds: ~55KB total (CSS + JS)
Only loaded when: Someone visits /AccFirmDemo
PhoenixFlix impact: 0 bytes (completely separate)

5. Vercel Optimization
Serves each route independently
Automatic compression (gzip/brotli)
Proper caching headers per route
Only delivers requested assets

Summary
The accounting demo is like having two completely separate websites that just happen to share the same domain. Your PhoenixFlix app performance remains exactly the same as before! 🚀
